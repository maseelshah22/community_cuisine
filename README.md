## About 🥘
Welcome to *Community Cuisine!*
* We built Community Cuisine knowing that food is a universal language that brings people together
* This website allows users to create and share recipes with other users
* It allows people to discover and try new foods at a click of a button, while also allowing them to share their family recipes with a broader audience
* This was built using Python's Flask Framework and designed using HTML/CSS. All information was stored in a MySQL database.
* All password data was secured using a custom password hashing function: no plain text passwords are visible to anyone.

## Design and Features 🖥️ 🍽 
* After creating an account, users can upload their favorite recipes using the ```Add Recipe``` form
  - There, they can add information including name, ingredients, ethnic origin, dietary restrictions, spice level, and more!
* When users search for a recipe, foods with names similar to the search key words will show up
* Once a recipe is selected, users will see information about it and they can upload a review and rate it out of 5 stars

## How to Run 💻

* After downloading the files and making sure you have downloaded all the necessary files in the ```requirements.txt```, navigate to the folder where the repository is located
* Now, go to your terminal and run ```python app.py```
  - You may have to be connected to UVA's internet in order to connect to the database
* Enjoy cooking!
